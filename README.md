# Fantasy-Baseball-ML-Model

I ran 50 mock drafts for my fantasy baseball league in order to gain insights on where certain players would be drafted. I'm working on a machine learning model in 
R that will project where certain players will be drafted and help me identify value and opportunity for my own league.

# Variables held constant

1. League Size (10 teams)
2. Scoring format (Head-to-head points scored weekly)
3. Platform (ESPN)
